    Below we have Gir eating his waffles as a .mp4 file. I mark this as a <video>, and then use a source to call it.
     Also, I link the background waffle in the css.
     I'm still not that experienced with how to link a file from my pc on css, which is why it is a URL at this time.

Here we have the start of our 'box'; this will be our container for anything we want to put on the page.
Otherwise, if we didn't have this or any styling choices, text will be directly on the waffle! 
That would be totally unreadable. And sticky. Gross.

<!--
    Below we finally start to label our counter through a new button id made in the css document.
    using the id in javascript allows me to use it in the javascript code. Below, I also use an id for my <p> tags
        this is where I plan to put the number of times a user clicks the button. -->
