 The reason why I use 'defer' in this tag is because I want my html and css to load first and foremost.-->

<!-- While not necessary, I made multiple body id in my .css as I wanted multiple cursors when needed
 for different pages. Pizzacursorbody is like the other body ids but i just changed the cursor. -->

    <!--This text appears at the very top of the body because I didn't place it inside of a div or add any breaks.
    I wanted to tell the player what this game was about without hurting their eyes, so it's greyed out through the css.-->
   
    <h1 id="h1-game">Roll a higher number of dice than me to win!</h1>

    <!--Here is where I finally begin to make my game. I create various ids to use within this code, as I will
    want the .js to be able to change what is inside the tags that hold those ids-->

        <!-- Here is where Gir will roll his dice, with the '0' between <span> tags being where the result will be.
            I use <span> tags here as they do not disrupt the theme of the page or the page layout-->

        <br>My dice roll = <span id="GirRollsRes">0</span>

<br><br><br><br><br> 

<!--I use this id to tell this nav to remain to the right of the page; I wanted my average score to be
somewhere more accessible-->



<!-- Here is where it gets more interesting - My button needs to be clicked, right? But I also want to 
 call in my .js somewhere. So in order to do that, I ask my script here to detect when I click this button (onclick),
 then I link the function I want to have work through this action.
 In this case, every time I click this button, I will activate my function in the .js and it will change elements inside
 of my html document, perform basic math and logic, and then my game is played. See code.js for more info-->

<!--Below here is the footer, where I create a new button with a simple link. While this button can be pressed, it's
only ever activated through the actual linking process.
For example, if I never linked anything to this button using href or <a> tags, I would not be able to 'click' the button
    as its kind of...just a cosmetic item, mostly.
    This button asks if a person wants to exit, as in return to my Index page.-->

        <a href="Index.html">

  <!--The <sub> tags simply make my texts smaller without fooling with ids or the .css document. 
    While I could use font sizing, I find that simply writing sub is easier to remember...it's bad habit.
    Another fun thing is the use of <sup>, but that floats the text up a bit much.-->
