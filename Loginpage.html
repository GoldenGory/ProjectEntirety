Below is how to link to a .css stylesheet
rel = relation. 
Choosing the relation to this document as "stylesheet" enables me to use the css I had made.

Then below that, I link my script to my page. This is essential if I want to get my page to work using the javascript
I created.

<!--Below is the start of my form, where the user will be asked to input their name, last name, and zipcode in order
to proceed to the index page. (If you spot any mention of a password, I admittedly created a username+password login at first.)

as taken from my notes about a form's onsubmit return false: "Without that onsubmit return false, what that does is 
returns true means you cannot navigate AWAY from this page. The return true is the DEFAULT of the forms tag, 
which means that WITHOUT the return set to false, the user will not be able to navigate away if they enter 
information into the form itself or activate something within the form that is meant to take them to another page."
-->

<form id="logins" onsubmit="return false">
First name: <input type="text" id="username"/> Last name: <input type="text" id="username2"/>
Zip code: <input type="number" id="zipcode"/>

<!--Below is out submit button. We give it the type "submit" which shows it as a button to press in our form.
I link my javascript function through that onclick; when the user clicks to submit their login information,
what I want javascript to do is to run that information and check if it is right according to the rules
I have set inside the javascript, then either deny running it with an error message OR play an alert that a user
has logged in correctly and then bring that user to a new page (the index page)

Below this input button, I also place a paragraph <p> with an id to tell it apart form any other paragraph 
    I use on this page. That way, in the case I want to use my javascript again, it will know to only change the lettering
    inside of the element id "longinstate", and not just every <p> paragraph. -->

<input type = "submit" onclick = "checksub();">

<p id="loginstate">Please log in to view the site.</p>

</form>

<!--Down below is my footer. Because the bottom of my page wasn't that far down because my page seems short,
I simply use my <nav> tag used prior. I changed the alignment of these nav tags to appear to the left of the page.
    That way my copyright notice won't get in the way.
    
    Use of <sub> tags just make the text smaller. 
        <sub>  makes text small and float down, 
            while <sup> would make text small and float up.-->
