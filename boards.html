     <center></center> This centers the text; Eventually I plan to have this done via css, but for now I use it as I'm comfortable with it.
    <h1></h1> is a heading type text. Very big text!

    Also, the id addition to lines I use in the rest of this document are merely for styling reasons.
    These are made via the css stylesheet. Using these, I can make multiple different styles for different ids 
    I would like to use.

    After this <div> below, I use <img src="">, this allows me to link an image from either online or through my documents.
        For the sake of this class, I linked from my own documents.
