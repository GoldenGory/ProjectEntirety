Below is how to link to a .css stylesheet
rel = relation. 
Choosing the relation to this document as "stylesheet" enables me to use the css I had made.

Same as linking the javascript, but this will allow me to use javascript should I need it for this page in the future
-->

    <link rel="Stylesheet" href="main.css">

<!-- 
<div></div>Divs are sort of like a 'box' to put things in. In my case, this was extra text.
-->
         
     <div><h1>Welcome to my page!</h1></div><br><br>
        
<!--
<center></center> This centers the text; Eventually I plan to have this done via css, but for now I use it as I'm comfortable with it.
<h1></h1> is a heading type text. Very big text!

Also, the id addition to lines I use in the rest of this document are merely for styling reasons.
These are made via the css stylesheet using #X, where X is the name I give the id.
Using these, I can make multiple different styles for different ids I would like to use.

After this <div> below, I use <img src="">, this allows me to link an image from either online or through my documents.
For the sake of this class, I linked from my own documents.

I also found out how to id an img src; adding the id="" towards the end!
-->

            <div id="div-diff1"><img src="OKSZ.gif" id="hesdancing"> 
            
            <h1 id="h1-diff">Do you like waffles?</h1>

<!--
<button></button> Is pretty much on the tin. Adds a button to press.
The id for all these are different so I may change their looks apart from each other.
               
Reminder on how to ID:
When I made these in the .css sheet, I typed:

#button1{}
#button2{}
#button3{}

I filled each {space} with the items I wanted to change, such as border or color.
                
Below, I link to another page I created in HTML in the last <button> tag.
-->
<nav>
              <a href="more waffles.html"><button id="button3">Feed me waffles!</button></a><a href="Game.html"><button id="button3">Play a game with me!</button></a><br><a href="boards.html"><button id="button3">Degree Information!</button></a><a href="Palindromes.html"><button id ="button3">Palindrome game</button></a>
        </nav>
        </div>   
<!--
<br> Merely adds a break between spaces. 
This one below was used to seperate this <div> from the last <div>, leaving a nice gap.

The reason I do not seperate with <p> is because I accidentally made style properties for <p>
that would NOT have done well inside of this <div> ID. 
As such, I treak <br> like <p> until I add an ID to <p> that will give me the same text results as if it were
on this <div> ID.

<!--
Below are more <img src="">, but this time I edit both the width and height.
I use style-"" to grab the 'float' line, which enables me to make an image 'float' to the position I want.
In this case, I have one on the right and one on the left.

I'd originally tried this with css through ID, but found adding an id to the img src code was a little above
my knowledge set.

Adding a popup text later would be fun, especially if I can tie it to one button.
